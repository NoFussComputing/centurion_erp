This Django Project is designed to be a tool that forms part of IT Service Management (ITSM). The goal is to provide a system that is not only an IT Information Library (ITIL), but that of which will connect to other ITSM systems, i.e. AWX for automation orchestration. Currently the template style is that of the Red Hat echo system (AWX, Foreman, EDA, Cockpit etc).
