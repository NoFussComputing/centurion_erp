Views are used with Centurion ERP to Fetch the data for rendering as html. We have templated our views to aid in quick development. We have done this by adding to our views the required pieces of logic so as to ensure the right information is available. The available API can be found within the [API Views](./api/common_views.md) docs.

The views that we use are:

- [Index](./api/common_views.md#index-view)

    A Models index page

- [Add](./api/common_views.md#add-view)

    For adding data to model tables

- [Change](./api/common_views.md#change-view)

    Changing data within a model

- [Delete](./api/common_views.md#delete-view)

    To Delete a model
